## 📜 Project Overview
**AI-Driven NFT Classification!**  
The project focuses on the classification of NFTs using various methods, primarily leveraging visual information. Each classification approach is organized separately in the GitHub repository, named according to the specific method or result.

## 🔍 Classification Approaches
- 🎨 **[Classification by Color](ClassificationbyColor/README.md):** Categorizes NFTs based on their color schemes.
- 🏷️ **[Classification by Tag](ClassificationbyTag/README.md):** Categorizes NFTs based on their associated tags.
- 🤖 **[Algorithm Detection](AlgorithmDetection/README.md):** Uses AI to detect the generative algorithms behind NFTs, providing insights into the creative process.
- 📜 **[Descriptive Model](DescriptiveModel/README.md):** Employs CLIP and BLIP models to generate concise and accurate descriptions of NFTs.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **🎨 Support for Artists:** Enhance visibility with relevant tag suggestions, empowering artists on FXHASH.
- **🕵️ Improved Navigation:** Boost search functionality by filling in missing tags and suggesting additional ones.
- **📊 Market Insights:** Analyze trends across FXHASH by applying the models to a broader collection of artworks..

## 🛠️ Tools and Models
- **🐍 Python 3.7**
- **🖼️ CLIP & BLIP:** For generating descriptions that capture the essence of each NFT.
- **🧠 ResNet-50:** A deep learning model for visual classification.
- **📝 Word2Vec & spaCy:** To handle text processing and keyword extraction.

## 📖 Glossary of Key Terms
- **🕰️ Epoch:** A full cycle through the dataset during training.
- **✅ Precision:** How many positive predictions are correct.
- **📈 Recall:** How well the model identifies true positives.
- **⚖️ F1 Score:** Balances precision and recall for uneven datasets.
